    "intro_a": "If you've ever looked at your grades and wondered how you're really doing overall — GWA is the answer.",
    "intro_story": "Back in college, I remember getting my grades and thinking, \"Okay... but is this good enough for the dean's list?\" That's when I first heard about GWA — and honestly, it changed how I looked at my performance.",
    "what_is_title": "What Exactly Is GWA?",
    "what_is_p1": "GWA stands for General Weighted Average. Sounds fancy, but it's just a smarter way of figuring out how well you're doing across all your subjects.",
    "what_is_p2": "Here's the idea: Not all subjects are equal. Your 3-unit math class? That should count more than your 1-unit PE class, right? GWA gets that. It gives more \"weight\" to subjects with more credit units. That's what makes it more accurate than just averaging your grades.",

    "good_2": "2.0 – 2.5 → Still solid",
    "good_3": "2.6 – 3.0 → Not bad, but you've got room to grow",
    "good_4": "Above 3.0 → Time to rethink a few habits",
    "good_outro": "Remember, some scholarships or honors programs require you to stay under 2.0 — so it's worth aiming high.",

    "story_p3": "That one class pulled my GWA way down.",

    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "desc": "Common questions about GWA calculation and our calculator tool",
    "q1": "How is GWA calculated?",
    "a1": "GWA (General Weighted Average) is calculated using the formula: GWA = (Sum of Grade × Units) ÷ (Sum of Units). This means each subject's grade is multiplied by its unit value, all products are summed up, then divided by the total number of units. This gives more weight to subjects with higher unit values.",
    "q2": "What's the difference between GWA and GPA?",
    "a2": "GWA (General Weighted Average) and GPA (Grade Point Average) are similar concepts but may use different scales. GWA typically uses a 100-point scale (0-100), while GPA often uses a 4.0 scale. Both consider the weight of units/credits, but the calculation method and scale may vary depending on the institution.",
    "q3": "Can I use this calculator for different grading systems?",
    "a3": "Yes! Our calculator works with any numerical grading system. Whether your school uses a 100-point scale, 4.0 scale, or any other numerical system, you can input your grades and get an accurate weighted average. Just make sure all grades use the same scale.",
    "q4": "What if I have incomplete grades or pending subjects?",
    "a4": "Only include subjects with final grades in your GWA calculation. Incomplete grades (INC) or subjects you're currently taking should not be included until you receive a final numerical grade. This ensures accuracy in your GWA computation.",
    "q5": "How often should I calculate my GWA?",
    "a5": "It's recommended to calculate your GWA at the end of each semester or term to track your academic progress. You can also calculate it mid-semester to see how current grades might affect your overall average and plan accordingly for remaining coursework."
